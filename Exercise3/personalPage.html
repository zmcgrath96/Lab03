        <b>The infamous Dinosaur on offline chrome is often overlooked.  He's not given the respect he deserves,

        <b>Origin</b> <br/>
        Dan is a dinosuar. <br/>  Being so, he didn't quite make it when the astroid came and separated him from his friends.
        He was lucky, however, in that his remains were left somewhat intact.  Because of this, when Google's secret
        team of archaeologists (part of project XTinct) found his remains in the Brazilian jungles,  they were able 
        to revive him.  This revolutionary new method then allowed them to revive his eternal rival, <br/> pTeri the 
        pterodactyl. 
      </p>

      <p class = "battle" >
        <b>Eternal battle</b><br/>
        Although the two of them <br/> may have been fortunate enough to have been revived, project XTinct had different
        plans for them.  Instead of being able to roam the earth freely as they once did, both of them were put 
        under extensive testing.  These tests came to be too much for them, and ended up dying as a consequence.
        (Moment of silence please). <br/>
        Unfortunately for Dan and pTeri, Google had already pulled their consiencesness from their bodies, and 
        put them into simulations.  This is what we see now in the playable "game".
